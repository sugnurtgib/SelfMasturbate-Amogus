Four Sides Dynamics (Also known as 4SD), is an 8 function model [[Carl Gustav Jung|Jungian]] typology system, based on the former MBTI.

Functions in 4SD have different meaning than those in classic MBTI.

4SD believes that the mind is dynamic and ever changing, and so people might show a different side of their persona. Which shows how careful one should type another one.

4SD added the typing grid, and it was the first one to do so.
