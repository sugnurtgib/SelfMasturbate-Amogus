Hugo at the age of 19

Hugo Miguel Trindade Parada (March 8th, 2004), is a Portuguese psychology, sociology, CS and CE student currently residing in [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal) is the current writer of the [[SelfMastery Nexus]]' Vault, as well as a psychology, sociology, CS and CE student from [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal).

Hugo started his career in typology in September 10th, 2022 for the purpose of emulating someone else in order to social engineer people. This ultimately fails but Hugo keeps on learning about this system in order to know more about himself and other people.

Hugo self types himself as an [[INTJ]] [[ILI]] 5w4 Sx/So 514, although some people suggest, [[ENTP]] [[LIE]] (sometimes [[SEE]]), [[INFJ]], [[ISTP]] and [[LSI]].

## Systems used

Hugo started off with 16p dichotomies immediately switching up to MBTI, where we settled through the course of November 2022 to April 2023. Hugo in the mean time, learned a bit about [[Socionics]] and Enneagram, but didn't gave them as much importance as MBTI. Later on Hugo met a group of people interested in the CSJ Community where he was presented with the concept of 4SD ([[Four Sides Dynamics]]). After Hugo had learned about this, he had completely taken MBTI out of his life and started using [[Four Sides Dynamics|4SD]] to type people and understand others.

Hugo decided to seggregate the types by two dichotomies and one identifier. Those being, Responding and Initiating, Abstract and Concrete, and then the number of the temple. 1 being Heart Temple, 2 being Soul Temple, 3 being Body Temple and 4 being Mind Temple.
